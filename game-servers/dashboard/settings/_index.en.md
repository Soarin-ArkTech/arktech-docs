## Settings
The Settings tab on your game panel is where you will find the FTP information, which is gone over in more detail in a [previous guide](/game-servers/dashboard/file-management). In addition, this is where you are able to reinstall your server, resulting in a completely clean and vanilla slate. The final ability is the option to change your server name within the game panel. This will not reflect in real-life, only for organization sake on the panel itself.
