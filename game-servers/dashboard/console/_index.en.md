## Server Console
The center and most important part of the game panel is the console. From here you can run commands, view server statistics, start/stop the server, etc.

Everything here is all very self-explanatory. The start button starts the service, restart will restart it, and stop will stop it. 

Seen here is the main stats panel. It will show the server name (as specified in the Settings tab, view more info [here](/game-servers/dashboard/settings/)), your server IP, CPU usage, RAM usage, and storage usage.

For more historical RAM and CPU data, view the graphs directly below the console window.
