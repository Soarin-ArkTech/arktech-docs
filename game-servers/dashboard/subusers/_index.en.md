## Game Panel Subusers
One of the abilities of our game panel is the feature to create new user accounts specifically for a server. This is useful in cases where you have trusted friends and would like to grant them access to the panel.

### Adding a Subuser
1. Navigate to the Users tab of your game panel.

2. Create a new user. You will need an email address, which will serve as the login email. Grant this user all the permissions you see fit, and invite user.
