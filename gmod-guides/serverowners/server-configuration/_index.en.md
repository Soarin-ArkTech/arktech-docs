## server.cfg
Found in `garrysmod/cfg`, this is the file that sets all of the server variables (sv or svars) on startup.

This is the default file generated by ArkTech. It is recommended to [generate your own](https://csite.io/tools/gmod-universal-cfg), as this is very bare-bones. *Please keep* the Network Settings and Execute Ban Files sections as they are.
```
// Please do not set RCon in here, use the startup parameters.

```

Extra tidbits that may be useful to server owners:
- sv_location 
    - This sets your server's location as seen in the Garry's Mod server browser. See more info on location flags [here](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Downloading_a_Dedicated_Server#locationflag).
- sv_alltalk 3
    - Setting sv_alltalk to 3 will make sure everyone in the server can hear voice chat.
- On any sbox_max limit, -1 sets no limit.

### Custom Loading Screen
Server operators are given the option to display custom webpages to connecting players instead of the default Garry's Mod loading screen. This option is offered through the "sv_loadingurl" parameter.

There are a few free loading screen creators out there, but nothing will beat spending money for a quality product and hosting it yourself. Here are a few good options:

- [cSite](https://csite.io/services/loading) (formerly TheCodingBeast) - Free
- [sleekLoad 2](https://www.gmodstore.com/market/view/sleekload-2-loading-screen_) - $4.99USD + Requires own web server
- [Striper Loading](https://www.gmodstore.com/market/view/striper-loading-a-garry-s-mod-loading-screen) - $4.99USD + Requires own web server
- [Mallard LoadScreen](https://www.gmodstore.com/market/view/sale-mallard-loadscreen-5-in-1-easy-cheap-configurable-loading-screen) $4.99USD + Requires own web server
- Making your own! 

## Steam Workshop Collections
Workshop collections are by far the easiest way to utilize addons on a Garry's Mod server. You can slim down loading times and user content amounts with a bit of cleverness and time, therefore raising your concurrent playercount.

### Server-Side Addons
Not all of your server addons need to be downloaded by the player. Things such as administrative mods, scoreboards, tools, there is no need to force download them to those joining. 

However in this collection, you must include all the addons the server must load, no matter if it's needed by clients or not. The ID of this collection will go into your startup parameters as the Workshop ID.

Here are some examples of popular addons that do *not* need to be downloaded by clients;
- Admin Mods (ULX, XAdmin, SAM, etc.)
- Tools (Wiremod, Advanced Duplicator, Precision, Stacker, etc.)
- Miscellanous (Stream Radio, PAC3, GDisasters Base Pack, etc.)

### Client-Side Addons
Addons such as materials, models, and vehicles, users must download them in order to not see errors and missing textures.

This is where the clientside collection differs from the serverside collection. In this, you will include all of the addons that clients will need, such as the addon types listed above. Once your collection is assembled, you will need to place them into the workshop.lua file. Generate one using the handy tool found [here](https://csite.io/tools/gmod-universal-workshop). A more thorough explanation on the workshop.lua file can be found [here](/gmod-guides/serverowners/mounting-addons/).

Here are some examples of popular addons that *do* need to be downloaded by clients;
- Materials (More Materials, GDisasters Material Pack, etc.)
- Car Addons (Simfphys, TDM Cars, LW Cars, etc.)
- Models (SProps, Steventechnos, etc.)

{{% notice note %}}
For servers with large amounts of content (>1.0gb) on a clientside collection, we strongly advise you not to put them all in your workshop.lua file, as those with bad internet will suffer.
